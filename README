WSGIFire: A web framework for Python 3

A web microframework for use with python 3.2+. The project is very early in development,
nowhere near production-ready, so if you aren't a hobbyist there's nothing to see here.
What better way to get into py3k and wsgi than to write a web framework?

Goals for v 0.1.0:
* thread-safe and test with mod_wsgi
* basic documentation on usage
* comprehensive testing

Notes:
The 'project' folder is a demo/testing application using WSGIFire.
